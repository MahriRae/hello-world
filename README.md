# hello-world
This is a test repository made to learn how to work GitHub.

At the time I am writing this, I am a recent graduate of Computer Science and wanted to create a portfolio for myself and the personal work that I plan to complete. I am interested in Android programing, but am not professionally trained and am completely self taught. I also am interested in creating games as a hobby, and learning about new ways to expand my knowledge and put it to good use.
